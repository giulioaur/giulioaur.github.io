        description: `For a videogame developer, joining a company that develop AAA games is like joining a pro team for a really good player:
                a dream coming true. I was hired as Gameplay programmer for joining the GenerationZero team at Systemic Reaction. As the
                time I'm writing this, few months are passed, so I can tell little about my experience here. Indeed switching to Apex engine
                was really challenging, starting to work anew with a game engine is a completely different experience after you already 
                worked in this world. Everything seems a bit more clear, even if as much exiting as the first time. As I stated, nothing much 
                more to say for the moment, but indeed the premises are the best I have ever seen.`

        description: `My first experience in the world of professional game developer, a big Milestone in my journey (sorry :( ). When 
                I started my experience here I was not really sure on which area of game programming I should have devoted myself to,
                but duties called, so I started as Junior Online programmer. Milestone, as a racing games company, rides really fast 
                and during my almost two years there I have experienced tons of different stuff: developing on multiple consoles,
                online programming, gameplay programming, performance analyst, some minor and temporary leading roles and other countless 
                little things. This is indeed not something that common for a junior programmer and it gave me the possibility to put my
                hand on more or less every aspect of the game programming. We used Unreal Engine, so I also had my first approach to a fairly
                big and complex professional game engine. I had already used it for a small project, but without the necessity to go deep
                into its code to debug any problem or to understand underlay mechanism, I would say that was really as I used it for the first
                time. I ended my experience here as Gameplay Programmer. `

        description: `CoderDojo is a no-profit association that aims to teach the computational thinking to children. I knew
                this amazing project in Pisa, where I joined the association as a Mentor. During my period there, I have taken part to 
                several events, during which we have mainly thought some basic programming concept to 6-13 years old children with 
                Scratch and Python. However, our activities were not limited to this, many times we have organized unplugged activities
                to teach other computer science related topics like the way a computer works, security and how the web works. <br/>
                I really liked my time spend with them and I really think they are doing a really great job, preparing the kids for 
                a world that is always more computer-dependant. `

        description: `During my bachelor's internship I have developed a mobile framework
                with the purpose to make very simple the development of mobile app based on the same content of web apps developed 
                with company's proprietary CMS. The whole framework has been developed entirely by me, using Ionic (AngularJS), 
                SQLLite and RestFULL calls to interface with the CMS. Nevertheless, for the whole time I have worked as part of a small
                team and during the later phases I have also started to experience my first meeting with a real client during the developing
                of the first apps. `

        description: `Choosing another university for my master degree was an important growth opportunity. I wanted not only to try different
                environments, different way of thinking and different professors, but also to start experiencing taking care of myself on
                my own (not a tragic story here, I love my family). I didn't chose a game-oriented degree cause I still wanted to learn about 
                different stuffs, I wanted to leave every computer science's doors opened. After some time I can say that was a wonderful
                choice, most of the things I learned in that two years is part of my daily work as videogames programmer.<br/><br/>

                back and say "GG Giulio of the past! Well played". Coming from a humanistic background this was not an easy ride, but indeed a
