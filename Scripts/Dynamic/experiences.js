                this amazing project in Pisa, where I joined the association as a Mentor. During my period there, I have taken part to 
                several events, during which we have mainly thought some basic programming concept to 6-13 years old children with 
                Scratch and Python. However, our activities were not limited to this, many times we have organized unplugged activities
                to teach other computer science related topics like the way a computer works, security and how the web works. <br/>
                I really liked my time spend with them and I really think they are doing a really great job, preparing the kids for 
                a world that is always more computer-dependant. `

                SQLLite and RestFULL calls to interface with the CMS. Nevertheless, for the whole time I have worked as part of a small
                team and during the later phases I have also started to experience my first meeting with a real client during the developing
                of the first apps. `
