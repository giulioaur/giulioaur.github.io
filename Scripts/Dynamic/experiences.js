        description: `After two years of forced separation, I finally reconnected with my one true love: Unreal Engine. But this time both
                it and me were a bit grown up: it has a whole new aspect and it was now called UE5, while I had gained the Senior title 
                through various quests around Europe. <br/>
                While I already had my fair share of remote experience (probably the one good things of a pandemy), this was my first full
                remote experience, and what an experience. Luckily I also had the pleasure of meeting the team in person for a bit. <br/>
                But in this new adventure, it was time to increase the difficulty and face yet a new genre: online competitive shooter, but
                with a twist, an integration with a scripting language (LUA) that would have allowed the users to customize the game modes. 
                When I started the game was already taking shape, but yet in its very first stages, so my first tasks were around basic 
                gameplay systems like inventory, weapon purchase and a data-driven attribute system, ideal to easily speak with LUA. Then for 
                a while I took full ownership of the UI, to create a general UI framework for the game (both C++ and LUA). But probably the
                biggest challenge I faced here was the creation from scratch of a UGC editor that would have allowed users to create custom
                maps, with focus on rapid iteration and game design. The editor should have been built without using Unreal Editor modules and
                without changing the Unreal Engine code. To be honest it was quite satisfying when the prototype was ready and we could play
                with a bunch of meshes. This is the main reason while I added the world "Tool" in the title for this role (a bit arbitrary,
                you would say, but aren't titles just arbitrary words after all? Yeah, I agree, this last phrase doesn't make a lot of sense). `

        description: `For a videogame developer, joining a company that develop AAA games is like joining a pro team for a videogame player:
                a dream coming true. I was hired as Gameplay programmer to join the GenerationZero live team at Systemic Reaction. During my 
                time here, I helped the team both dealing with legacy systems, trying to improve and modernize them, and building entirely new 
                systems from scratch. My proudest achievements here were indeed the development of two revolutionary gameplay mechanics for the 
                game: the building system and the procedural generated bases. The former allowed the players to build its own base, thanks to a 
                grid-system and a big range of pre-made buildings, that would have helped them to repel the horde of FNIX robots. But FNIX is 
                not just any AI, so, thanks to the procedural generation, the evil robots were able to build their own bases, ready to destroy 
                every human that would have had the courage to enter their walls. <br/> 
                However, in more than two years, I touched almost every aspect of the game and tried to help the team with every request. I also 
                spent a fair amount of time optimizing the CPU performances for old-gen consoles (Xbox One and PS4). <br/>
                Here I also had a small parenthesis as a mentor for a junior programmer, but truly speaking he did not need too much mentoring.
                <br/><br/> 
                But all the programming gigs aside, what I really appreciated here the most of my team here was indeed the team and all the super
                fun things we did together. They really helped my growing as a team member more then a programmer.`

        description: `My first experience in the world of professional game developer, a big Milestone in my journey (sorry :( ). When 
                I started my experience here I was not really sure on which area of game programming I should have devoted myself to,
                but duties called, so I started as Junior Online programmer. Milestone, as a racing games company, rides really fast 
                and during my almost two years there I have experienced tons of different stuff: developing on multiple consoles,
                online programming, gameplay programming, performance analyst, some minor and temporary leading roles and other countless 
                little things. This is indeed not something that common for a junior programmer and it gave me the possibility to put my
                hand on more or less every aspect of the game programming. We used Unreal Engine, so I also had my first approach to a fairly
                big and complex professional game engine. I had already used it for a small project, but without the necessity to go deep
                into its code to debug any problem or to understand underlay mechanism, I would say that was really as I used it for the first
                time. I ended my experience here as Gameplay Programmer. `

                several events, during which we have mainly thought some basic programming concept to 6-13 years old children with 
                Scratch and Python. However, our activities were not limited to this, many times we have organized unplugged activities
                to teach other computer science related topics like the way a computer works, security and how the web works. <br/>
                I really liked my time spend with them and I really think they are doing a really great job, preparing the kids for

                different stuffs, I wanted to leave every computer science's doors opened. After some time I can say that was a wonderful
