        description: `A new funny and interactive way to show my cv in a RPG style. It could be played clicking on the header. 
                        The interface is inspired by my favourite RPG game, but since I am not a UI designer, there are still 
                        some imperfections I will try to fix in future versions.It is fully realised with HTML and JS, with the help of 
                        Bootstrap and Jquery.All the visualized stuff about the pg is dinamically recovered from a JSON file, so 
                        new characters can be easily added just modifying it and without touching neither HTML or JS files.I have 
                        also implemented a simple parser for the basic pseudo-code used to show abilitie's animation.`

        description: `This is a project I have realized with my colleague Andrea Lisi and it
                        is my first VR project.We have realized it with Unity Engine for the course of Virtual Environment, it is
                        freely inspired to "Ready Player One".Our basic idea was to realize a completely
                        customizable room when you can watch a movie, listen to the music and chat with friends.
                        Here we also try to experiment different kind of VR interaction with the 3D object.
                        Unfortunately, the multiplayer part did never see the light due to lack of equipment,
                        nevertheless we are very proud of the result.`

                        to start learning about this huge and fantastic world.I have build it following
                        the mini- books Raytracer in one week(end) of Peter Shirley, and up to now I have
                        not still finished them.This is still a basic raytracer, but I want to add more
                        and more features to make it as good as I can, so maybe I'll continue to work on it on
                        my free time.`

        description: `This is my very first big project, and I'm very proud of it: it is my
                        personal neural network.I have realized it as project for the course of
                        Machine Learning.It's rather simple, but it can solve all the basic
                        tasks a Neural Network should solve and do it very well and fast enough. 
                        I have realized it with the goal of build a fully and easily customizable 
                        neural network.It uses a gradient- descent learning algorithm that minimizes
                        every function the user passes.I hope you will like it as much as I enjoy
                        to build it, and if it will be so, don't forget to leave a star =P`

        description: `Searching on the web I have found not too much material about this
                        topic, so I decide to put my slides on github since they were very
                        appreciated.They are short and clear, but most importantly they have a 
                        slide full of references(web article and paper).I think that Cloud
                        Gaming could be a very successful idea, but up to now competitive 
                        gaming, that has the biggest slice of pie in the game's market, is not
                        supported at all.But following the right path, it will surely become
                        the future of the gaming, destroying all hardware limitation.`
